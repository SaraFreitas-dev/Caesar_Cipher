# Caesar Cipher

A terminal-based Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption tool built in Python. 
This classic cryptographic technique shifts letters in the alphabet by a specified number of positions.

## How to Use

1. **Download the Project Folder**: Clone or download the repository.
2. **Run the Cipher**: Open the file `playCaesarCipher.bat` to start the program in your terminal.
3. **Follow the Prompts**: 
   - Type `encode` to encrypt a message.
   - Type `decode` to decrypt a message.
   - Enter your message and the shift number when prompted.
   - The program will display the encoded or decoded result and ask if you want to go again.
